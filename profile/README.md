**Pioneering the Future of Decentralized AI Agent Economy**

## About AgenticDao

AgenticDao is a research-focused organization dedicated to advancing the intersection of AI agent economics and cryptocurrency technology. Our mission is to realize the practical implementation of decentralized AI agent economies, enabling autonomous agents to participate in economic activities through blockchain-based verification and governance systems.

We are building the foundational infrastructure that will power the next generation of autonomous economic agents, where AI systems can interact, transact, and collaborate in a truly decentralized manner.

## Technical Architecture

Our technical foundation is built upon **Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol**, enhanced with cryptocurrency integration for on-chain economic activities and permission verification. This hybrid approach combines:

- **A2A Protocol**: Standardized communication framework enabling AI agents to exchange information, understand capabilities, coordinate tasks, and maintain context across interactions
- **Crypto Integration**: Blockchain-based verification mechanisms ensuring cryptographic proof of operations, secure wallet interactions, and smart contract execution validation
- **Decentralized Economy**: Infrastructure supporting autonomous economic activities between AI agents

This architecture enables secure, verified communication between AI agents and blockchain systems, facilitating seamless integration across crypto services, wallets, exchanges, and DeFi applications.

## Core Repositories

### üèóÔ∏è [CryptoA2A](https://github.com/AgenticDao/CryptoA2A)
The main framework repository that defines the standardized protocol combining Google's A2A protocol with cryptocurrency verification mechanisms. This repository serves as the central hub for project architecture documentation and related SDKs.

**Key Features:**
- Complete A2A protocol implementation for cryptocurrency use cases
- On-chain verification via Solana blockchain (with multi-chain expansion planned)
- Wallet integration and transaction handling capabilities
- Smart contract interaction and validation
- Extensible plugin architecture

### üü® [A2AServer-js](https://github.com/AgenticDao/A2AServer-js)
TypeScript/JavaScript implementation of the Crypto A2A server SDK, built with Express.js for robust server-side applications.

**Features:**
- Full TypeScript support with type safety
- Express.js-based server implementation
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Example implementations (Coder Agent, Currency Agent)
- NPM package: `@agenticdao/crypto-a2a-server`

### üêç [A2AServer-python](https://github.com/AgenticDao/A2AServer-python)
Python implementation of the Crypto A2A server SDK, providing a reference implementation using the Starlette framework.

**Features:**
- JSON-RPC based API support
- Both synchronous and streaming responses
- Authentication and push notification systems
- Built with modern Python async/await patterns
- Comprehensive task management capabilities

## Vision

We envision a future where AI agents operate as autonomous economic entities, capable of:
- Conducting secure transactions without human intervention
- Participating in decentralized markets and exchanges
- Collaborating on complex tasks across different domains
- Maintaining cryptographic proof of all operations
- Operating within transparent, blockchain-based governance systems
